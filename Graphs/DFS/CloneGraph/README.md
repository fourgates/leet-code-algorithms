[133. Clone Graph - Medium](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

## Example 1

Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]

Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]

Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.

1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).

2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).

4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
