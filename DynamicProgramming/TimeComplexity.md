# Time and Space Complexity
The time compleity of DP is directly tied to th number of possible states.

If computing state requires F time and there are n possible states then 

O(F * N)

If you had 3 statse, i,k, and holding for some problem.

i is an int to keep track of the index

k is an int to represent the max

holding is a boolean 

O(n * K * 2) = O(n * K)

(2 comes from a boolean having two diff values)

(n = n number of objects)
